        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The title element controls what shows up in the browser tab for the website.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visual content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The section element organizes the content on the webpage by topic.</li>
          <li>The name of a semantic element describes its content and role on the webpage.</li>
          <li>Alt text for images is important for accessibility and can improve SEO</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used to style an element directly in the HTML. For a particular page element only, and not very flexible.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet: contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML. The rules apply only to that page.</li>
          <li>External style sheet: preferred bc it has all CSS rules in a separate file, which makes changes easier. Linked using a link element in the head of the file.</li>
          <li>The * selector (wild card) applies the rules to all elements on the page.</li>
          <li>Using the class attribute as a selector allows you to choose which elements will be assigned to CSS rule.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in the code. The = assigns data to a variable.</li>
          <li>A method is a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer, ex: .log()</li>
          <li>An argument is the data inside of the parenthesis of a method.</li>
          <li>Link a script.js file to the index.html file right above the closing tag for the body element.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs in order from top to bottom.</li>
          <li>Conditional statements and loops can interrupt control flow and decide the order in which code is executed.</li>
          <li>When using an if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition or is true.</li>
          <li>Falsy values: 0, -0, On, “”, null, undefined, NaN, or a boolean with the value of false.</li>
          <li>All other values are considered truthy</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable used to hold a group of related data.</li>
          <li>An index is a unique number used to identify the location of a piece of data in an array. The first item in any array has an index of 0.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array. It allows a single code block to be executed repeatedly.</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. It must be called in order to execute.</li>
