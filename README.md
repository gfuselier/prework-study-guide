# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- Students who are beginning a bootcamp learn a lot of information in a short period of time. A common challenge for bootcamp students is keeping track of the information they learn.
- The Prework Study Guide helps students organize and review the topics covered during prework.
- While building this webpage, I learned how to use VS Code and the terminal for MacOS, as well as the basics of HTML, CSS, Git/GitHub, and JavaScript.

## Usage

To use the Prework Study Guide, review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. In the console tab, you will see a list of topics students learned from the prework along with a suggestion of which topic to study first.
